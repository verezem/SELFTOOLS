 1. First Edit the header file to make it suitable for your NEMO configuration.

 2. meta_mean.sh file works for mean_ssh.sh and mean_fwflx.sh launch. Check what particular script is chosen there. 

 3. mean_ssh.sh and mean_fwflx.sh computes yearly means of sea surface height and fresh water flux (via surface) correspondingly.

 4. transport.sh computes mean water volume tranport through the sections specified in the header.sh file. 

 5. After all yearly means are computed, you can run yearmean.sh script which yields to period mean for all variables. 

 6. Now you have everything to plot the balance! (wfbal.py)
